Project Title

Life Expectancy Analysis Using Machine Learning on WHO Dataset

Project Description

This project involves analyzing life expectancy data from the World Health Organization (WHO) using machine learning techniques.
The goal is to build a predictive model to estimate life expectancy based on various health and demographic features.

Objectives

    Explore and preprocess the WHO dataset.
    Apply machine learning techniques to predict life expectancy.
    Evaluate the performance of different models.

Data Description

    Dataset: WHO dataset containing various health and demographic features.
    Features:
        Country
        Year
        Status
        Adult Mortality
        Infant Deaths
        Alcohol
        Percentage Expenditure
        Income Composition of Resources
        (and others)
    Target Variable: Life Expectancy

Steps Involved

    Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
        Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized relationships between features and target variable. Examined feature distributions to understand the data better.
        Handling Missing Values: Used imputation techniques to fill in missing values.
        Feature Encoding and Scaling: Applied LabelEncoder encoding to categorical features and standardized numerical features.

    Model Building:
        Train-Test Split: Split data into training and testing sets.
        Model Selection: Used Linear Regression for predictive modeling.
        Cross-Validation: Applied cross-validation to assess model performance and robustness.

    Model Evaluation:
        Metrics: Evaluated model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and RÂ² score.
        Results: Analyzed actual vs. predicted values to understand model accuracy.

Results

    Cross-Validation Mean MSE: [Provide the value]
    Cross-Validation Standard Deviation of MSE: [Provide the value]
    Sample Predictions:
        Actual values vs. Predicted values (e.g., 73.7 vs. 70.08)

Conclusion

    Insights: Summarized key insights from the analysis.
    Model Performance: Discussed model performance and potential areas for improvement.
